This is the old version of the planthydra mobile application written in Typescript with react-native, on expo

The expo mobile app is used to run this

npm install
expo start

Code:
CommandScreen - schedules, watering history, status and device control
LoginScreen 
UserScreen - User details and notifications

This is a proof of concept and in no way a showcase of coding best practices
