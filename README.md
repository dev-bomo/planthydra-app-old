This is the old version of the planthydra mobile application written in Typescript with react-native, on expo

The expo mobile app is used to run this

npm install
expo start

Code:</br>
<b>CommandScreen</b> - schedules, watering history, status and device control</br>
<b>LoginScreen</b></br> 
<b>UserScreen</b> - User details and notifications

This is a proof of concept and in no way a showcase of coding best practices
